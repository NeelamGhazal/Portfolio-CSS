      <p>My journey in the world of coding began in 2023 when I joined <b>GIAIC</b> to pursue my passion for technology. During my time here, I have mastered key skills such as <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>Next.js</b>, and <b>Tailwind</b>, laying a strong foundation for my future in <b>web development</b>.</p>
<br/>
<p>Before diving into the tech world, I pursued an <b>Advanced Diploma in Media Science</b> at <b>Arena Multimedia</b>, which gave me a creative edge. I worked as a <b>2D Animator</b> with <b>Express News</b> on a freelance basis, where I contributed to several dynamic projects. Alongside this, I honed my skills as a <b>3D Artist</b>, specializing in <b>hard surface modeling</b> while working with various clients as a freelancer.</p>
<br/>
<p>Now, with a solid background in both <b>creativity</b> and <b>technology</b>, I am determined to explore and excel in <b>emerging technologies</b> to expand my expertise and make a meaningful impact in the industry.</p>
